Some attempts at OCR-ing the MNIST datasets.

The [MNIST database site](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) includes training &
test data, plus a review of many techniques and their performance. LeCun 98 (pdf
in papers/) also provides a broad overview of techniques.

To get the MNIST data files, run `get-mnist-data.sh`, or download the files
from the above site and use gunzip to decompress them.
